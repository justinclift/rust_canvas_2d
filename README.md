# Initial play around with the 2D canvas using Rust wasm

Initially based upon the "without-a-bundler" rustwasm example
[here](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/tree/master/examples/without-a-bundler).

The code can be built locally with:

```
$ ./build.sh
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to run it.
